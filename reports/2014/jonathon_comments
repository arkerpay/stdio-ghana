Issues

Majority of comments deal with logistics.  Cadre logistics concern issues affecting the cadre of instructors.  Course logistics concern presentation of the course.

Deficiencies in logistics planning primarily cost instructors time in trip preparation.  This time was billed to the ONR-RC program in the form of IDT/ATP.  Had logistics been more streamlined, the IDT/ATP funds could have been used to support other projects in ONR.

Cadre Logistics

Administrative requirements to enter AFRICOM AOR were being identified periodically throughout the pre-deployment phase.  Multiple versions of guidance (in pdf format) were released during this phases, with additional requirements promulgated via e-mail as the departure date.  While an officer was assigned the duties to coordinate these logistics, it appears as an observer, that she did not receive complete information from her AFRICOM points of contact.

The incremental identification of requirements cost a small amount of additional time for analysis of the requirments, redundant reporting and caused a small amount of frustration.  Regardless, the trip went off as planned.

COCOMs are large organizations, but there should be an office dedicated to tracking administrative requirements for personnel entering the AOR.  Recommend that an officer who is part of the ***instructor cadre*** be given the collateral duty to liase with the COCOM and create one set of guidance in checklist form for all training, medical and administrative requirements.  Allow me to reiterate:  one DEFINITIVE LIST in CHECKLIST FORM.  This will allow the instructors to do as little thinking about administration as possible and focus on course content preparation.

If possible, the admin-logistics officer should have civilian employment at a COCOM or government agency.  This will make coordination much easier for obvious reasons.


Passport/Visa

ONR does not support reservists in obtaining official passports or obtaining visas.  As a result, the instructor cadre was left to their own devices to obtain passports and visas.  This cost instructors a large amount of time as they independently researched requirements, filled out forms, etc.  

Original guidance was to send the visa application to a drilling reservist in Pensacola who happened to have the credentials to submit a visa request to the DoD office.  I did not have confidence in this guidance and expended a large amount of time (billed to ONR) to discover the right way to do this.

Fortunately, I already had an official passport from previous active duty.  I had no experience with visas; my previous command handled this for all travelers. Ideally, my reserve center should have processed my visa application.  The training office at NOSC Raleigh took the visa for action, but got back to me over a week later, admitting they did not have the capacity to submit my visa.

I discovered the visa guidance for Ghana on the DoD site and called the office so that I could get a plain language explanation of how the process worked.  One detail was that Ghana required a letter of invitation to enter the country; we did not have these letters!  Swift action by the project officer resulted in obtaining the letters only 5 weeks prior to our departure date.

Also fortunately, I work at a COCOM (USCENTCOM).  Despite the fact I am a contractor, because of *personal contacts* from prior active duty, the passport/visa office at USCENTCOM processed my visa application for Ghana.
