Issues

Majority of comments deal with logistics.  Cadre logistics concern issues affecting the cadre of instructors.  Course logistics concern presentation of the course.

Deficiencies in logistics planning primarily cost instructors time in trip preparation.  This time was billed to the ONR-RC program in the form of IDT/ATP.  Had logistics been more streamlined, the IDT/ATP funds could have been used to support other projects in ONR.

Cadre Logistics

Administrative requirements to enter AFRICOM AOR were being identified periodically throughout the pre-deployment phase.  Multiple versions of guidance (in pdf format) were released during this phases, with additional requirements promulgated via e-mail as the departure date.  While an officer was assigned the duties to coordinate these logistics, it appears as an observer, that she did not receive complete information from her AFRICOM points of contact.

The incremental identification of requirements cost a small amount of additional time for redundant reporting and caused a small amount of frustration.  Regardless, the trip went off as planned.

COCOMs are large organizations, but there should be an office dedicated to tracking administrative requirements for personnel entering the AOR.  Recommend that an officer who is part of the instructor cadre be given the collateral duty to liase with the COCOM and create one set of guidance in checklist form for all training, medical and administrative requirements.  If possible, this officer should have civilian employment at a COCOM or government agency.  This will make coordination much easier for obvious reasons.
